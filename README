Welcome to the Joom!Fish multi lingual extention

This extension is tested against the Joomla 2.5.x versions. Based on the changes
it might work with other newer versions but there is no service / support for them.


The Joom!Fish extention is a translation manager that extends the core multi lingual
features of Joomla with an advanced management of the localization process. It
includes specific features to simplify the translation of extensions that do not offer
the core translation capabilities yet.


The key features of the fish are:
 * Possibility for an unlimited amount of languages
 * Possibility to MANUAL translate all dynamic information of your Joomla!
   or the additional components/modules within ONE database
 * Overview of the changed contents in the translation list
 * Capabilities of front end translation
 * Module for language selection
 * SearchBot for searches within translated contents
 * Relationship to Google Translate API
 
 
If you have further questions you are welcome to consult the project website
http://www.joomfish.net

Please understand that the Joom!Fish development team can not provide you any
support nor consulting without payment. The extension is provided as it is
and support is an additional service.
